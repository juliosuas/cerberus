## The Problem

Most SMBs can't afford a $200K/year security engineer or a $50K/year SIEM. But they face the **same threats** as enterprises — ransomware, phishing, data breaches, compliance fines.

**Cerberus closes that gap.** One platform. Automated scanning. AI-driven recommendations. Beautiful dashboards. Deploy in minutes.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Infrastructure Scanning** — Port scans, SSL/TLS grading, HTTP header audits, DNS checks, SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation, subdomain takeover detection
- 📡 **Continuous Monitoring** — Uptime, SSL cert expiry, domain expiry, CVE matching, website defacement detection
- 🚨 **Breach Monitoring** — Employee email breach checks, credential leak detection, domain mention monitoring across paste sites
- 📊 **Compliance Scoring** — OWASP Top 10, SOC 2 readiness, GDPR exposure, PCI DSS basics, ISO 27001 gap analysis — each scored 0–100
- 🤖 **AI Security Advisor** — Plain-language recommendations prioritized by business impact, with step-by-step remediation playbooks
- 🎨 **Enterprise Dashboard** — Dark-themed SaaS-quality UI with security scores, compliance radar, threat timelines
- 👥 **Multi-Tenant** — Manage multiple clients from a single instance (MSP-ready)
- 🔔 **Notifications** — Email, Slack, WhatsApp, and generic webhook integrations
